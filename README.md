# IDE: Used Visual Studio Code/Google Colab for writing the code; used Terminal/Google Colab to run the code
# Instructions for running your executables:
#   Unzip the project folder and navigate to project src folder
#   Execute "python3 nst.py <style_image_path> <content_image_path> <number_of_iterations>” to execute NST tasks for VGG19 layer analysis for style and content. 
#       For example: "python3 nst.py style.jpeg dancing.jpeg 5000”
#       generated output image with different combination of style and content layers will be saved in the same folder as ‘nst.py’ file.
#       Loss for each combination is displayed for every 1000 iterations.
